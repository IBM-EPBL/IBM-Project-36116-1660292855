Plasma Donor Application


Plasma donation requires a commitment both in the amount of time for each donation and frequency of donation. Typically it takes between one and three hours to donate source plasma, and plasma can be donated twice within a seven day period. Whole blood donation takes less time—under 30 minutes—and donors donate less frequently—no more than once in eight weeks. The programs may fit into a donor's life differently at various times in the donor's life, and are equally important in helping to fulfill a vital medical need.

In a plasma-only donation, the liquid portion of the donor's blood is separated from the cells. Blood is drawn from one arm and sent through a high-tech machine that collects the plasma. The donor's red blood cells and platelets are then returned to the donor along with some saline.
